I know I say I will change
If you pull through for me
But I'm back to?my?ways
By the end?of the week

Try to stand?on my own
But I fall to my knees
You're the shepherd
That leaves the 100 for me

By myself I may try my best
But my best ain't good enough
When my faith ain't strong and I can't go on
And there's no one else to trust
