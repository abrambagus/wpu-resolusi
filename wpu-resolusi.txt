I know I say I will change
If you pull through for me
But I'm back to?my?ways
By the end?of the week

Try to stand?on my own
But I fall to my knees
You're the shepherd
That leaves the 100 for me

By myself I may try my best
But my best ain't good enough
When my faith ain't strong and I can't go on
And there's no one else to trust

You're the one who always keeps your promises
Over again and again and again and again
Even when I fail you keep your promises
Over again and again and again and again

It's not over til you say it's finished, oh no
And I know that if you said it, you meant it
Lord, on my own I would lie
I would steal, I would cheat

But you sent down your son
So I could be redeemed
Before I even ask, you provide what I need
When the battle seems lost, you still have victory

By myself I may try my best
But my best ain't good enough
When my faith ain't strong and I can't go on
And there's no one else to trust, oooh

You're the one who always keeps your promises
Over again and again and again and again
Even when I fail you keep your promises

Over again and again and again and again
It's not over til you say it's finished, oooh
And I know that if you said it, you meant it
