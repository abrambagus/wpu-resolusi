Today another day has gone
And i'm still here all alone
Stuck with the pieces of yesterday

Yesterday wasn't enough
Sometimes life can be so tough
With all your loved ones hurting you

What about faith
Doesn't it conquer
And it gives you strength and hope to carry on

Singing nananana
Singing nananana
Don't you worry
I'll be fine
Someday

What is life without heartache
Every downfall build and teaches us some new things everyday

Now this is faith
It does conquer
And it gives you strength and hope to carry on

Singing nanananana
Singing nanananana
Don't you worry
I'll be fine

Singing nanananana
Singing nanananana
Don't you worry
I'll be fine
Someday

Singing nanananana
Singing nanananana
Don't you worry
I'll be fine

Singing nanananana
Singing nanananana
Don't you worry
I'll be fine

Singing nananana
Singing nananana
Don't you worry
I'll be fine
Someday
